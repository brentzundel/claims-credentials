- Credential Manifest Specification is in unchanged "Strawman" Status since the beginning of the year. Focus has been on the Presentation Exchange workitem.

- Example Use Case:
    - Incentives for the Credential Ecosystem: How can a Marketplace create natural incentive layers for issuing and exchanging verifiable credentials.
    - How can Marketplace layer accelerate the interoperability between different "identity networks"
- Specification will likely generate requirements for existing specs like Presentation Exchange or Credential Manifest
- 7-day objection period for workitem from today's meeting
