# WACI Presentation Exchange


## Work Item Owners
- Orie Steele (@OR13)
- Brent Zundel (@brentzundel)

## Outcome
**When your work item is successful, then what will have changed in the world? What
will we be able to do that wasn't possible do before or vice versa?**

We will have a standard protocol for requesting and submitting a presentation of
a variety of credentials formats. 

## Deliverables
- **Does your work item have any deliverables? These include code projects,
  standards-track specifications, reports, registries, summaries, blog posts,
  and anything else that is instantiable and publishable in written form to a
  broader audience.**

We are writing a standards-track specification, which will include a complete
set of test vectors covering all messages exchanged by the protocol.

- **What's the expected timeline?**

We will release v0.1 for developer use by June 1 2021

- **Who's the audience of your deliverables?**

We are writing for developers who need to ask for and exchange claims that are
verifiable, such as Verifiable Credentials.

- **What are related resources or standards from DIF or adjacent
  organizations?**

JSON-LD Signatures, JWT, DIF Presentation-Exchange, DIDComm, and WACI.

## Meetings
- **Are there regular meetings? If so, when?**

Yes, Mondays at 1 PM PT/4 PM ET at [this Zoom link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88301532931?pwd=d0pISWZWNFozU3RkTmJxME0rd1FBZz09).

- **What are the goals of the meeting?**

To further work on the specification.

- **Do you have specific discussion topics in mind, or is it meant to move a
  deliverable forward?**

To move our deliverable forward, we will review the outstanding GitHub issues,
using [this link](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc).

When we have specific goals such as a release target (e.g., `v0.1`) or items
labeled "High Priority", then we may add additional filters for going through
issues.

- **Where are the notes and recordings published, if any?**

The recordings are published in the #general channel on the DIF Slack. There
are no notes, however automated transcription is a possibility and actions are
mainly taken in GitHub issues.

- **Who might be interested in attending?**

Anyone interested in a protocol for asking for and receiving presentations.
